Example:
php use sql to get all relevant markers based on passed in lat long
outputs that as XML

My imp:
use django python to get relevant markers based on passed in lat long
outputs as JSON
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/importing_data

JSON will work as long as json file is on same domain as script
Question:
Where does the XML doc returned by php in the example stored

NB / TODO:
NB about sql statement: To search by kilometers instead of miles, replace 3959 with 6371.
When user loads webpage grab user loc or default to glasgow
